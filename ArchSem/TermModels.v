  (** ** Architectural state

  This module define a concept of an architecturally defined state. This is a
  state that is fully defined architecturally and independent of any
  micro-architectural details (and is therefore independent of concrete
  hardware).

  Such a state is an abstraction of a micro architectural state where all the
  caches are fully coherent, including things like TLB and icaches

  Those state should be interpretable by any concurrency models.

  Currently this does not support CHERI tags, even if the interface supports
  them *)

  (** * General terminating architecture model

      This section defines general terminating models which are CPU architecture
      models that are defined by the set of final state reachable from a given
      initial state. Given that there is no fundamental notion of termination,
      they use a provided [terminationCondition] that gives the program point at
      which one must examine final state as if that program point was a strong
      synchronization point. *)
